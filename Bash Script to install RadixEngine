I have wrote a bash scrpit that can be used to download the depndencies, source code, and make the program in three steps.
#Step 1:  Install the dependencies that will be needed to compile RadixEngine.
#Step 2:  Download the source code that you will need, and put you in the correct directory.
#Step 3:  Create a build directory, go to that directory, and make the program.

Here is what you can do to use the script on Ubuntu 20.04.  

Step 1:  I created this script using the nano editor from a terminal.  To install nano use the command "sudo apt-get install nano".  
Step 2:  Create a file called "Build_Radix.sh".  You can do this from the terminal with the command "sudo nano Build_Radix.sh".
Step 3:  Save your edits to the file using the command "Ctrl + x", then hit y to save the file, and finally press "Enter" to save everything, and get back to the terminal.
Step 4:  Make the script executable. You can do this however you want to on your system.  One way to do this from the terminal is with the command "sudo chmod + x Build_Radix.sh".
Step 5:  Finally, you can run the script by typing "./Build_Radix.sh", and hit the "Enter" key.  This will run the bash script based upon the steps outlined at the beginning of this document.  

Here is the code contained within the script file.  
#!/bin/bash

#Step 1:  Install the dependencies that will be needed to compile RadixEngine.
sudo apt-get install cmake make gcc pkg-config lib{assimp,epoxy,sdl2{,-mixer},bullet,tinyxml2,gl1-mesa,unittest++,freeimageplus}-dev

#Step 2:  Download the source code that you will need, and put you in the correct directory.
sudo git clone https://github.com/GlPortal/RadixEngine.git
cd RadixEngine
sudo git submodule init
sudo git submodule update

#Step 3:  Create a build directory, go to that directory, and make the program.
sudo mkdir build 
cd build
sudo cmake ..
sudo make

This script ran with no errors on a Dell Inspiron 530s and a Gateway SX2110G.  Both of which run Ubuntu 20.04.
